# chicago-rides

Chicago has published data regarding ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft, and is the first city to have publicized this information. Datasets on drivers, vehicles, and trips have been released. 
For this analysis, I used the trips dataset, which has data on over 17 million ride-sharing trips from November 2018 to December 2018. 

Interested in if there were any differences in ride-sharing behavior on Christmas holiday versus an arbitrary day (that was the same day of the week), I looked at the ride-share data in the city of Chicago on the dates of 12-04-18 and 12-25-18. 

The Shiny App I created allows users to look through different parts of the trips dataset and compare differences between the two dates. Most graphics are interactive and allow the user to toggle dates and values.
